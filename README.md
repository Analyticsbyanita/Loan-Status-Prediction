A brief about Support Vector Machine Model

The algorithm that we shall be using for this purpose, is the Support Vector Machine. Support Vector Machine,(SVM), falls under the “supervised machine learning algorithms” category. It can be used for classification, as well as for regression. In this model, we plot each data item as a unique point in an n-dimension,(where n is actually, the number of features that we have), with the value of each of the features being the value of that particular coordinate. Then, we perform the process of classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiates the two classes.

Banks are making major part of profits through loans. Though lot of people are applying for loans. It’s hard to select the genuine applicant, who will repay the loan. While doing the process manually, lot of misconception may happen to select the genuine applicant. Therefore we are developing loan prediction system using machine learning, so the system automatically selects the eligible candidates. This is helpful to both bank staff and applicant. The time period for the sanction of loan will be drastically reduced. In this paper we are predicting the loan data by using some machine learning algorithms that is Decision Tree.
